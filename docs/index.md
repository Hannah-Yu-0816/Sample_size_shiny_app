# Sample Size Simulation App

Welcome to the documentation page for the Sample Size Simulation Shiny App.

This tool helps researchers estimate the required sample size for detecting treatment effect heterogeneity 
under different simulation settings. Hello.

---

## About the App

- **Purpose**: Support research design by simulating scenarios where treatment effects vary across individuals.
- **Target Users**: Clinical trial designers, biostatisticians, epidemiologists.
- **Model Used**: Causal Forest with Honesty Method.

---

## Background and Motivation

In clinical trials, traditional sample size calculations typically target the overall treatment effect 
(Average Treatment Effect, ATE), assuming that all patients respond similarly to treatment. 

However, in reality, treatment effects can vary substantially across individuals. 
This heterogeneity in treatment response necessitates a shift from focusing solely on the overall effect 
to studying heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE).

Our project specifically addresses the following questions:
- What sample size is required to reliably detect heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE)?
- How can simulation-based methods assist in planning studies that account for treatment effect variability?

Through simulation-based approaches, we aim to provide practical guidance for researchers designing studies 
that seek to uncover treatment effect heterogeneity.

## Output Interpretation

Two indices are defined to show the sample size needed to reveal the heterogeneity: 
heterogeneity captured by effect modifiers and success ratio of pure effect modifier leaf. 

### Heterogeneity Captured by Effect Modifiers

The percentage of heterogeneity captured is calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{\frac{1}{n_1}\sum\limits_{i \in S_1}CATE\left(\prod_{j=1}^{k} X_{ij}=1;\underset{\sim}{X_{-ij}}\right)
\-
\frac{1}{n_0}\sum\limits_{i \in S_0}CATE\left(\prod_{j=1}^{k} X_{ij}=0;\underset{\sim}{X_{-ij}}\right)}
{ground \ truth \ of \ CATE}
\times
100\%
$$

Where:
- $S_1$ is the subset where all selected effect modifiers $X_{ij} = 1$
- $S_0$ is the subset where all selected effect modifiers $X_{ij} = 0$
- The ground truth of CATE is obtained from the data simulation process.

### Success Ratio of Pure Effect Modifier Leaf

The second metric focuses on tree structure: We measure the success rate of trees that split on the effect modifier among the forest.

For this, we look atÂ each individual treeÂ in the forest and classify it into one of three categories: success, partial success, and unsuccess.

- Success: The tree successfully isolates the effect modifier/phenotype group.
- Partial Success: The tree isolates only a subset of the effect modifier/phenotype group.
- Failure: The tree splits on noise and cannot isolate the true subgroup at all.

We then calculate theÂ proportion of success, partial success, and failureÂ across all trees in the forest.

Here is an example with just two variables: $X_1$ is the effect modifier, and $X_2$ is other risk factor. 
The eight trees in the following image representÂ all possible splitting structuresÂ for two binary variables.

- Trees 1 through 4, and Tree 8, are consideredÂ successÂ â€” they isolate effect modifier $X_1$ cleanly
- Trees 6 and 7 areÂ partial successÂ â€” they isolate a subset of $X_1$ 
- Tree 5 is aÂ failureÂ â€” it splits only on noise

For more than one effect modifiers, we define success when the tree can find a leaf that seperate all "on" effect modifiers (i.e., equal to 1). 
This mimics aÂ phenotype-driven mechanism, where the treatment only works if a certain biological profile is fully expressed.

## Simulation Process

Hereâ€™s how the simulation is structured.

We start by evaluating aÂ grid of sample sizes.
At each sample size, we repeat the simulationÂ 500 times (or the time you choose to run)Â to ensure results are stable and not due to randomness.

For each simulation run, we follow four steps:
1. Generate dataÂ with effect modifiers we got from the user
2. Build a causal forestÂ using that data
3. Compute the two heterogeneity indicesÂ we defined earlier â€” heterogeneity captured and tree success rate
4. Finally, weÂ record the result, and after 500 runs, we take theÂ medianÂ as the final estimate for that sample size

To make this efficient, everything isÂ implemented in parallel.

### Parameter Tuning Panel

After selecting the overall sample size for your clinical trials. Then you can come to the second panel: Parameter Tuning. 
In this panel, you will have a chance to tune the sample.fraction and honesty.fraction parameters to see their impact on the two indices.
